This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-In Python, encapsulation is achieved through a combination of conventions and mechanisms:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Private and Protected Attributes (by Convention):** Python doesn't have strict keywords like `private` or `protected` as found in some other languages (like Java or C++). Instead, encapsulation is often achieved by convention using naming conventions:\n",
        "    * **Single underscore (`_`):** A single underscore prefix (e.g., `_my_attribute`) is a convention indicating that an attribute or method is intended for internal use within the class or module. While it doesn't strictly prevent external access, it signals to other developers that they should not directly access or modify this member from outside the class.\n",
        "    * **Double underscore (`__`):** A double underscore prefix (e.g., `__my_attribute`) triggers a mechanism called **name mangling**. Python internally changes the name of the attribute to include the class name (e.g., `_ClassName__my_attribute`). This makes it harder, but not impossible, to access the attribute from outside the class, providing a stronger form of encapsulation. It's primarily used to avoid naming conflicts in inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Getters and Setters (Methods):** While not strictly necessary due to Python's dynamic nature, you can explicitly define getter and setter methods to control access to attributes. Getters are methods that retrieve the value of an attribute, and setters are methods that modify the value of an attribute. This allows you to add logic or validation when accessing or modifying data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Properties:** Python's `property` decorator provides a more Pythonic way to achieve controlled access to attributes. It allows you to define methods for getting, setting, and deleting an attribute and access them as if they were regular attributes. This provides a clean interface while still allowing you to add logic behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, Python relies on naming conventions, name mangling, and the use of getters, setters, and properties to achieve encapsulation. While it doesn't enforce strict access restrictions like some other languages, these mechanisms provide developers with the tools to control how data and methods are accessed and modified within a class, promoting good programming practices and maintaining data integrity."

This is where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When you call that method on an object, the specific implementation in the object's class is executed.\n",
        "*   **Method Overloading (not directly supported in Python in the same way as some other languages):** In some languages, polymorphism can also be achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters. Python does not support traditional method overloading in this way, but similar behavior can be achieved using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",

You can write functions or methods that operate on a general type (the superclass or interface) and have them work correctly with any specific object that is an instance of a subclass, without needing to know the exact type of the object at compile time. This makes your code more adaptable to new classes and behaviors."

        "\n",
        "* **Flexibility and Extensibility:** Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a uniform way. This makes your code more flexible and easier to extend because you can add new classes without having to modify existing code that uses a polymorphic interface.\n",
        "* **Code Reusability:** By allowing objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass, polymorphism promotes code reusability. You can write generic functions or methods that operate on the superclass type, and these functions will work correctly with any subclass object.\n",
        "* **Simplified Code:** Polymorphism can simplify your code by reducing the need for complex conditional statements (e.g., `if-elif-else` chains) to handle different object types. Instead, you can rely on the appropriate method implementation being called based on the object's actual type at runtime.\n",
        "* **Maintainability:** Polymorphism makes your code more maintainable. If you need to change the behavior of a specific class, you can do so by overriding methods in that class without affecting other parts of the code that use the polymorphic interface.\n",
        "* **Abstraction:** Polymorphism works closely with abstraction by allowing you to focus on the common interface of objects rather than their specific implementations. This helps in creating more abstract and high-level designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, polymorphism enables you to write more adaptable, reusable, and maintainable code by allowing objects to take on \"many forms\" and respond to the same method calls in different ways based on their specific types. It's a powerful tool for creating robust and scalable software systems."

        "Ans-The `super()` function in Python is a built-in function that provides a way to access methods of the parent class (or superclass) from within a subclass. Its primary significance lies in facilitating inheritance and maintaining proper method resolution in complex class hierarchies, especially in cases of multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's why `super()` is important:\n",

        "* **Calling Parent Class Methods:** The most common use of `super()` is to call a method that has been overridden in the subclass but you still want to execute the parent class's version of that method. This is particularly useful in the `__init__` method of a subclass to call the parent class's constructor and initialize the inherited attributes.\n",
        "* **Handling Method Resolution Order (MRO):** In cases of multiple inheritance, where a class inherits from multiple parent classes, `super()` plays a crucial role in correctly navigating the Method Resolution Order (MRO). It dynamically determines the next class in the MRO to call the method from, ensuring that methods are called in the correct order according to Python's C3 linearization algorithm. This helps to avoid issues that can arise in multiple inheritance, such as the diamond problem.\n",
        "* **Code Maintainability:** Using `super()` makes your code more maintainable. If you change the name of the parent class or the class hierarchy, you don't need to manually update the calls to parent methods in the subclass. `super()` handles this dynamically.\n",
        "* **Avoiding Explicit Parent Class Naming:** Before `super()` was introduced, you had to explicitly refer to the parent class by name when calling its methods (e.g., `ParentClass.__init__(self, ...) `). `super()` eliminates this need, making the code cleaner and less prone to errors if the parent class name changes.\n",

Python's garbage collector determines when objects are no longer referenced and can be safely deleted. This means that `__del__` might not be called immediately after the last reference to an object is removed, and in some cases, it might not be called at all (e.g., if the program terminates abruptly).\n",
        "* **Potential Issues:** Due to the unpredictable nature of garbage collection, relying heavily on `__del__` for critical resource management can be problematic.

        "Q25 What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-In Python, the `__call__` method is a special method (dunder method) that allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. When you define the `__call__` method in a class, you can then call objects of that class using parentheses `()` just like you would call a regular function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the purpose and significance of the `__call__` method:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Making Objects Callable:** The primary purpose is to make instances of your class callable. This can be useful when you want an object to behave like a function, performing some action when it's called.\n",
        "*   **Creating Function-like Objects (Functors):** Classes with a `__call__` method are sometimes referred to as \"functors\" or \"callable objects.\" They allow you to encapsulate both data (in the object's attributes) and behavior (in the `__call__` method) in a single entity that can be invoked like a function.\n",
        "*   **Stateful Functions:** Unlike regular functions, which are typically stateless, callable objects can maintain state through their instance attributes. This allows them to remember information between calls, which can be useful for various programming patterns.\n",
        "*   **Decorators:** The `__call__` method is often used when creating decorators using classes. A class-based decorator typically has an `__init__` method to store the decorated function and a `__call__` method to wrap the execution of the decorated function.\n",
        "*   **Callback Functions:** Callable objects can be used as callback functions, where an object is passed to another function or method to be called later.\n",
